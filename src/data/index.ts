    content: `Vuior’s platform is built around the principle of “Pay Early, Save Big.” By analyzing your bills, 
    due dates, and payment habits, our system identifies opportunities for early payment discounts

    - And more!`,

    value: "q5",
    title: "How does the early payment discount work?",
    content: `When you pay your bills before the due date, Vuior automatically applies savings based on 
    our negotiated rates. For example, if your utility bill is $300 due on the 10th and you pay on the 
    3rd (7 days early), you could save around 10% or $30. Our platform calculates these savings for 
    each bill, giving you a clear view of your total monthly savings.`,

    - A Savings Tracker that shows your cumulative savings (e.g., “Total Monthly Savings: $255”).
    - Automated Alerts that remind you of upcoming bills and the benefits of paying early.
    
    **Example:**  
    Imagine you have two bills:  
    - A $300 utility bill due on the 10th. You pay on the 3rd, saving 10% ($30).  
    - A $1,500 rent payment due on the 1st. You pay on the 24th of the previous month, saving 15% ($225).
